# Time Complexity
Since these questions are all multiple choice I'm going to write down the write answers here

## Basic Primer
| Name | Answer |
| --- | --- |
| [LOOP_CMPL](https://www.interviewbit.com/problems/loop_cmpl) | O(N + M) time, O(1) space |
| [NESTED_CMPL](https://www.interviewbit.com/problems/nested_cmpl) | O(N * N) time, O(1) space |
| [NESTED_CMPL2](https://www.interviewbit.com/problems/nested_cmpl2/) | O(N*N) |
| [CHOOSE4](https://www.interviewbit.com/problems/choose4/) | X will always be a better choice for large inputs

## Math
| Name | Answer |
| --- | --- |
| [WHILE_CMPL](https://www.interviewbit.com/problems/while_cmpl/) | O(log N)
| [NESTED_CMPL3](https://www.interviewbit.com/problems/nested_cmpl3/) | O(N)


## Compare Functions
| Name | Answer |
| --- | --- |
| [CHOOSE1](https://www.interviewbit.com/problems/choose1/) | n^3 / (sqrt(n))
| [CHOOSE2](https://www.interviewbit.com/problems/choose2/) | f3, f2, f4, f1
